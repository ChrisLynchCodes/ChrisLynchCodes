### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### My name is Chris Lynch. I am an aspiring developer from Scotland. 
I am currently in my final year of university studying BSc Computer Science and ***looking to gain employment before graduation*** **Summer 2022**.

I completed an internship in 2021 where I worked as a fullstack ASP.NET developer for an SME building a web application from the ground up in Scotland. I learned **A LOT** here through taking part in daily standups, working with expereinced devs implementing things such as the repository pattern in the data access layer, and using tools such as AutoFac to implement dependency injection and Dapper to configure mappings, and using the dev express visual component suite.


- C#, Dotnet Core/Framework
  -Web API, MVC, Dapper, AutoMapper, AutoFac   
- JavaScript, React, Node Express
- SQL Server Mongo DB
- HTML CSS
