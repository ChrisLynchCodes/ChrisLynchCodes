### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### My name is Chris Lynch. I am an aspiring developer from Scotland. 
I am currently in my final year of university studying BSc Computer Science and ==looking to gain employment== :pray: before graduation **Summer 2022**. I had an internship in 2021 where I worked as a fullstack ASP.NET developer for an SME in Scotland where I learned **A LOT** through taking part in daily standups, working with expereinced devs implementing things such as the repository pattern in the data access layer, and using tools such as AutoFac to implement dependency injection and Dapper to configure mappings.

## Projects
I am currently working on my final year honours project which is a full stack e-commerce application. 
- [x] Storing my data in a MongoDb database hosted as a service through MongoDb Atlas
- [x] Querying my database with a dotnet core WebApi 
- [x] Consuming my API in my React SPA 

[dotnet core API](https://github.com/ChrisLynchCodes/HonsAPI)
[React SPA](https://github.com/ChrisLynchCodes/HonsAPI)

I have a number of other projects in my repos but the above are the biggest in scope.
